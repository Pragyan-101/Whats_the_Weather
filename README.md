# Whats_the_Weather
It is a simple Android application which shows the real time weather of different cities. 

Used Volley Library to fetch JSON data using GET request method from an URL provided by a public API and uses user input(City name) as a query for the URL to fetch the weather of that particular city.

You can copy the whole repository and run the application on a emulator or your android device.
If you want to see only the the java code file/ xml file/ resources used then open the files in app->src->main

Thank you!!
